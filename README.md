**QCRAFT Quantum Collaborative Interface** is a quantum circuit development platform designed for real-time collaboration. It enables multiple users to **co-edit quantum circuits synchronously** through a shared visual interface. This functionality is built on a custom adaptation of the **Operational Transformation (OT)** model, tailored specifically for quantum circuits.

## Documentation

- [📖 Manual de Desarrollador (Español)](./Manual_Desarrollador.md)
- [📖 Developer Manual (English)](./Developer_Manual.md)

## Key Features

- **Real-time collaborative editing of quantum circuits**  
  Users can co-design circuits in a shared Quirk-based interface. Edits are synchronized instantly using a WebSocket-based OT protocol adapted for quantum data structures.

- **Operational Transformation for Quantum Circuits**  
  Unlike traditional OT for text, our adaptation works with quantum circuit elements—each with semantic context such as qubit state, gate type, and spatial position (row/column).

- **WebSocket Synchronization Layer**  
  Ensures low-latency, bidirectional communication and full support for the OT model, allowing efficient and scalable collaborative workflows.

- **Dual-backend Architecture**  
  Combines Django for persistent user/session management with **Spring Boot** for optimized real-time collaboration services. This separation improves scalability, maintainability, and performance.

- **Cross-platform execution**  
  Collaborative designs can be translated and executed on IBM Quantum or AWS Braket, including visual results and cost estimation.

- **Deployment as Quantum Services**  
  Circuits can be deployed in Docker containers and exposed as web services for reproducible and accessible experimentation.

- **Interactive Debug Mode**  
  Visualize quantum circuit execution step-by-step. Inspect intermediate states, column-wise results, and final outcomes with dynamic visual tracking.


## Workflow Overview

1. **Collaborative Design**: Multiple users build circuits in real time via Quirk.
2. **Synchronization**: All changes are propagated using an OT model over WebSockets.
3. **Code Translation**: Circuits are translated to Qiskit or Braket code.
4. **Execution**: Users can launch executions on AWS or IBM devices.
5. **Result Visualization**: Real-time access to execution outcomes and performance metrics.
6. **Debugging**: Analyze circuit behavior step-by-step to verify logic using the interactive Debug Mode.

## Repository Structure
